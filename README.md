## About
Our sophomore research project. We are building a neural network that will identify cardiovascular diseases using PyTorch. The neural network will be deployed to a nodeJS web server that will host a page on which visitors can input their conditions and get predictions in real time.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Roadmap
* Build the neural network
* Convert to Rust or develop custom C library
* Develop a quantum version using qiskit and test on IBM Quantum lab
* Connect neural network to a NodeJS web server.
* Host a webpage for at least 3 months.

## Usage
not possible yet :(
